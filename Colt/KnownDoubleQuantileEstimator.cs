     * Approximate quantile finding algorithm for known <tt>N</tt> requiring only one pass and little main memory; computes quantiles over a sequence of <tt>double</tt> elements.
     *
     * <p>Needs as input the following parameters:<p>
     * <dt>1. <tt>N</tt> - the number of values of the data sequence over which quantiles are to be determined.
     * <dt>2. <tt>quantiles</tt> - the number of quantiles to be computed.
     * <dt>3. <tt>epsilon</tt> - the allowed approximation error on quantiles. The approximation guarantee of this algorithm is explicit.
     *
     * <p>It is also possible to couple the approximation algorithm with random sampling to further reduce memory requirements. 
     * With sampling, the approximation guarantees are explicit but probabilistic, i.e. they apply with respect to a (user controlled) confidence parameter "delta".
     *
     * <dt>4. <tt>delta</tt> - the probability allowed that the approximation error fails to be smaller than epsilon. Set <tt>delta</tt> to zero for explicit non probabilistic guarantees.
     *
     * You usually don't instantiate quantile finders by using the constructor. Instead use the factory <tt>QuantileFinderFactor</tt> to do so. It will set up the right parametrization for you.
