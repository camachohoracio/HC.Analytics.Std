    /**
    Status: Experimental; Do not use for production yet. Hash map holding (key,value) associations of type <tt>(int-->int)</tt>; Automatically grows and shrinks as needed; Implemented using open addressing with double hashing.
    First see the <a href="package-summary.html">//package summary</a> and javadoc <a href="package-tree.html">tree view</a> to get the broad picture.

    Implements open addressing with double hashing, using "Brent's variation".
    Brent's variation slows insertions a bit down (not much) but reduces probes (collisions) for successful searches, in particular for large load factors.
    (It does not improve unsuccessful searches.)

            Brent's variation does a local reorganization to reduce probes. It essentially means:
            We test whether it is possible to move the association we probed first (table[p0]) out of the way.
            If this is possible, it will reduce probes for the key to be inserted, since it takes its place; it gets hit earlier.
            However, future probes for the key that we move out of the way will increase.
            Thus we only move it out of the way, if we have a net gain, that is, if we save more probes than we loose.
            For the first probe we safe more than we loose if the number of probes we needed was >=2 (t>=2).
            If the first probe cannot be moved out of the way, we try the next probe (p1).
            Now we safe more than we loose if t>=3.
            We repeat this until we find that we cannot gain or that we can indeed move p(x) out of the way.
